## Compilation
Compile with _pdfLaTeX_:
```
$ pdflatex main.tex
```
It's also possible to compile each part individually from the root directory. For example:
```
$ pdflatex src/intro.tex
``` 
List of required packages is in preamb.tex.

For an easier way to install packages and manage the project, try using _tectonic_:
```
$ tectonic main.tex
```
