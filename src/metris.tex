    Materials, apparatus, and procedures. List and describe key materials and apparatus. Then describe the procedure in enough detail that others can duplicate it. For design studies, this section includes component design, fabrication, assembly, and testing procedures. Use illustrations.

    Results. Present the results, usually with accompanying tables and graphs. Characterize the patterns and quality of the results and estimate their accuracy and precision. Detailed data go to an appendix. Use analytical graphics.
